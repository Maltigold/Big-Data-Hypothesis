# Big-Data-Hypothesis

# Hypothesis 1:
# Comparing Average Bicycle Rental Durations in Spring and Autumn 2014
In this hypothesis, my focus lies on the theory stating that bicyclists tend to ride longer 
in the Autumn than in the Spring. To analyze this claim, I utilized a dataset 
encompassing bike rental data, such as each ride's beginning and ending times. The main goal 
was to identify whether there is a notable disparity in average ride durations between the Spring 
(March, April, May) and Autumn (September, October, November) of the year 2014.

# Hypothesis 2:
# MORE PEOPLE DIED FROM ASTHMA IN AUTUMN THAN IN SPRING IN 2014
This hypothesis presents an analysis of asthma deaths in England and Wales from 2001 to 2014. The 
dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). 
This analysis aims to explore the trends and patterns in asthma deaths over the specified 
time period.
